# Portal Linking Compass

---

## Description:

Portal Linking Compass is a Fabric mod that allows finding the exact coordinates
of where to build a Nether portal in either dimension to link them up perfectly.

The mod must be installed on both client and server to be able to function properly.

## Why this mod was created:

The mod was originally created because I wanted to try and play the game without coordinates (reducedDebugInfo  gamerule set to true).

Almost everything in-game can be done without coordinates. Maps, compasses and lodestone compasses (albeit a little expensive) are a great tool for locating previously visited places.

However, a few things aren't possible without coordinates. Such as:
- Linking Nether portals
- Finding the coordinates to manipulate and generate an End Gateweay in the middle of the void.
- A bunch more things I haven't thought of.

This mod tackles at least the first problem and allows players to build proper Nether hubs.
I thought I may as well publish the mod for other people like me.


## How to install:
1. Download JAR from:
   - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/portal-linking-compass) page
   - [GitHub releases](https://github.com/maxoduke/Portal-Linking-Compass/releases) page

2. Put the JAR in your mods folder.
3. Make sure you have Fabric API installed.


## How to use:

### Step 1:
Craft a Portal Linking Compass using a Crafting Table.  
The recipe is unlocked after picking up a compass, and will become visible in the recipe book.  
It requires:
- 6 Obsidian
- 1 Diamond
- 1 Netherite Ingot
- 1 Compass

         </dd>
      </dl>
   </dd>
</dl>


### Step 2:
- Right-click a Nether portal block with the compass.

         <dd>
            <img width="300px" src="https://maxoduke.me/assets/images/mods/portal-linking-compass/step2.jpg" alt="Right-click Portal with compass" />
         </dd>
      </dl>
   </dd>
</dl>

- The compass should now point to Nether portal block.
- Go to the Nether, the compass should point to the exact coordinates where you can build the portal to link them up perfectly.
- This also works viceversa. That is, original portal in the Nether âž” Find coordinates in the Overworld.
- If the Portal that was right-click is destroyed, the Compass will start spinning randomly.
